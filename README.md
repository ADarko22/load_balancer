# BALANCER

# Description:
This is a simple TCP/IP socket redirection application that offers a
little more complexity than the simple fork-based datapipes that are
commonly available. This source has been successfully compiled and
used on Linux, FreeBSD, and Win32. I have released it into the
public-domain.
